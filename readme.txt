The Pixtulate responsive images plugin connects wordpress sites to the on demand image cropping, scaling and optimization services of Pixtulate. The plugin enables every WP site to serve responsive images which adapt to the visitor's screen size automatically right after signup. 

== Description ==
We provide further enhancements via intelligence focal points which ensure images are always cropped and scaled to feature their main subject. Our image optimization dramatically speeds up websites with image content. All sites also automatically benefit from Pixtulate's global CDN for fast image delivery worldwide.

The plugin simplifies configuration and automates certain otherwise manual tasks on WP sites.
